#+TITLE: Some stirring quotes


“Excellence can be obtained if you CARE more than others think is wise,
RISK more than others think is safe, DREAM more than others think is practical,
and EXPECT more than others think is possible.” -- Author Unknown (attr? Claude Bissell, Michaelangelo, ...)

There are two ways to slide easily through life; to believe everything
or to doubt everything. Both ways save us from thinking.  -- Alfred Korzybski

By relieving the brain of all unnecessary work, a good notation sets it
free to concentrate on more advanced problems. -- Alfred North Whitehead

A Key to Wisdom:  Strong opinions that are weakly held.

Attributed to Paul Saffo of the Palo Alto Institue of the Future.

"[He] explained that weak opinions are problematic because people aren't
inspired to develop the best arguments possible for them, or to put forth the
energy required to test them. [He] explained that it was just as important,
however, to not be too attached to what you believe because, otherwise, it
undermines your ability to see and hear evidence that clashes with your
opinions."  -- Bob Sutton (http://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/07/strong_opinions.html)

No person, and no company, incapable of failing cheerfully will ever achieve anything great.

     -- Edwin Land  (of Polaroid fame)

--------------------------------

    [T]o the selfish and original passions of human nature, the loss
or gain of a very small interest of our own, appears to be of vastly
more importance, excites a much more passionate joy or sorrow, a much
more ardent desire or aversion, than the greatest concern of another
with whom we have no particular connexion. His interests, as long as
they are surveyed from this station, can never be put into the balance
with our own, can never restrain us from doing. whatever may tend to
promote our own, how ruinous soever to him. Before we can make any
proper comparison of those opposite interests, we must change our
position. We must view them, neither from our own place nor yet from
his, neither with our own eyes nor yet with his, but from the place
and with the eyes of a third person, who has no particular connexion
with either, and who judges with impartiality between us. Here, too,
habit and experience have taught us to do this so easily and so
readily, that we are scarce sensible that we do it; and it requires,
in this case too, some degree of reflection, and even of philosophy,
to convince us, how little interest we should take in the greatest
concerns of our neighbour, how little we should be affected by
whatever relates to him, if the sense of propriety and justice did not
correct the otherwise natural inequality of our sentiments.

    Let us suppose that the great empire of China, with all its
myriads of inhabitants, was suddenly swallowed up by an earthquake,
and let us consider how a man of humanity in Europe, who had no sort
of connexion with that part of the world, would be affected upon
receiving intelligence of this dreadful calamity. He would, I imagine,
first of all, express very strongly his sorrow for the misfortune of
that unhappy people, he would make many melancholy reflections upon
the precariousness of human life, and the vanity of all the labours of
man, which could thus be annihilated in a moment. He would too,
perhaps, if he was a man of speculation, enter into many reasonings
concerning the effects which this disaster might produce upon the
commerce of Europe, and the trade and business of the world in
general. And when all this fine philosophy was over, when all these
humane sentiments had been once fairly expressed, he would pursue his
business or his pleasure, take his repose or his diversion, with the
same ease and tranquillity, as if no such accident had happened. The
most frivolous disaster which could befal himself would occasion a
more real disturbance. If he was to lose his little finger to-morrow,
he would not sleep to-night; but, provided he never saw them, he will
snore with the most profound security over the ruin of a hundred
millions of his brethren, and the destruction of that immense
multitude seems plainly an object less interesting to him, than this
paltry misfortune of his own.

   -- Adam Smith, Theory of Moral Sentiments, Part III, Chapter III


--------------------------------

When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: "If you live
each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be
right." It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33
years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: "If
today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about
to do today?" And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days
in a row, I know I need to change something.

Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've
ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because
almost everything -- all external expectations, all pride, all fear of
embarrassment or failure -- these things just fall away in the face of
death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are
going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you
have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not
to follow your heart.

   -- Steve Jobs,  commencement address, Stanford University, 2005

--------------------------------


In science one tries to tell people, in such a way as to be understood
by everyone, something that no one ever knew before. But in poetry,
it's the exact opposite.

   -- Paul Dirac

--------------------------------

The scientist is not a person who gives the right answers; he is one who asks
the right questions.

   -- Claude Levi-Strauss, Le Cru et le cuit (1964)

The great tragedy of science: the slaying of a beautiful hypothesis by an ugly fact.

   -- Thomas Henry Huxley

A gentleman need not know Latin, but he should have at least forgotten it.

 -- Brander Matthews

--------------------------------

 "It is the tragic story of a mental short circuit", Vaclav Havel wrote
 in a marvelous 1985 essay on a different topic. "Why bother with the
 never ending, genuinely hopeless search for truth when a truth can be
 had so readily, all at once, in the form of an ideology or doctrine?
 Suddenly it is all so simple. Think of all the difficult questions
 which are answered in advance!"

--------------------------------

Intellect distinguishes between the possible and the impossible,
reason distinguishes between the sensible and the senseless. Even the
possible can be senseless.

 -- Max Born

--------------------------------

We want experiences, fitting ones, of profound connection with others,
of deep understanding of natural phenomena, of love, of being
profoundly moved by music or tragedy, or doing something new and
innovative, experiences very different from the bounce and rosiness of
happy moments. What we want, in short, is a life and a self that
happiness is a fitting response to -- and then to give it that
response.

 -- Robert Nozick

-------------------------------------


Of all tyrannies, a tyranny exercised for the good of its victims may
be the most oppressive. It may be better to live under robber barons
than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may
sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those
who torment us for our own good will torment us without end, for they
do so with the approval of their consciences.

 -- C. S. Lewis

* An alternate and longer form (which is right?)

Theocracy is the worst of all governments. If we must have a tyrant, a robber
baron is far better than an inquisitor. The baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep,
his cupidity at some point be sated; and since he dimly knows he is doing wrong
he may possibly repent. But the inquisitor who mistakes his own cruelty and lust
of power and fear for the voice of Heaven will torment us infinitely because he
torments us with the approval of his own conscience and his better impulses
appear to him as temptations...

The nearer any government approaches to Theocracy the worse it will be. A
metaphysic, held by the rulers with the force of a religion, is a bad sign. It
forbids them, like the inquisitor, to admit any grain of truth or good in their
opponents, it abrogates the ordinary rules of morality, and it gives a seemingly
high, super-personal sanction to all the very ordinary human passions by which,
like other men, the rulers will frequently be actuated. In a word, it forbids
wholesome doubt. A political programme can never in reality be more than
probably right.

 -- C. S. Lewis

Statistics is the generation and effective use of knowledge from data -- data
with all their uncertainty, fallibility, and variability.

 -- Miron L. Straf, Presidential Address to the 2002 Joint Statistical Meetings
                    (cf. JASA 98 1)

-------------------------------------

A big name professor is someone who can get away with saying dismissable things that won't be dismissed.

           -- Henry Farrell  (a blogger and political scientist)

-------------------------------------

Good legal scholarship should make (1) a claim that is (2) novel, (3) nonobvious, (4) useful, and (5) sound.
And the claim should (6) be seen by the reader to be novel, nonobvious, useful, and sound.

           -- Eugene Volokh in Academc Legal Writing (with acknowledgement to Stephen Carter)


-------------------------------------

A popular government without popular information, or the means of
acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy, or perhaps
both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance, and a people who mean
to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power which
knowledge gives.

           -- James Madison, in a letter to W.T. Barry, August 4, 1822

-------------------------------------

Saints should always be judged guilty until they are proved innocent.

           -- George Orwell

-------------------------------------

 "... there are many reasons why you might not understand [an
 explanation of a scientific theory] ... Finally, there is this
 possibility: after I tell you something, you just can't believe
 it. You can't accept it. You don't like it. A little screen comes
 down and you don't listen anymore. I'm going to describe to you how
 Nature is - and if you don't like it, that's going to get in the way
 of your understanding it. It's a problem that [scientists] have
 learned to deal with: They've learned to realize that whether they
 like a theory or they don't like a theory is not the essential
 question. Rather, it is whether or not the theory gives predictions
 that agree with experiment. It is not a question of whether a theory
 is philosophically delightful, or easy to understand, or perfectly
 reasonable from the point of view of common sense. [A scientific
 theory] describes Nature as absurd from the point of view of common
 sense. And it agrees fully with experiment. So I hope you can accept
 Nature as She is - absurd.

 I'm going to have fun telling you about this absurdity, because I
 find it delightful. Please don't turn yourself off because you can't
 believe Nature is so strange. Just hear me all out, and I hope you'll
 be as delighted as I am when we're through. "

        Richard P. Feynman (1918-1988), from the introductory lecture on quantum mechanics 
        reproduced in QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter (Feynman 1985)


-------------------------------------

For every [person], the world is as fresh as it was at the first day, and as
full of untold novelties for him who has the eyes to see them."

        Thomas Henry Huxley, A Liberal Education (1868)


-------------------------------------

To study history one must know in advance that one is attempting
something fundamentally impossible, yet necessary and highly
important. To study history means submitting to chaos and nevertheless
retaining faith in order and meaning. It is a very serious task, young
man, and possibly a tragic one.

        Father Jacobus (from Hermann Hesse's Magister Ludi)

-------------------------------------

The whole secret of the teacher's force lies in the conviction that
men are convertible. And they are. They want awakening.

        Ralph Waldo Emerson

-------------------------------------

Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle.

        Philo of Alexandria 

-------------------------------------

Where you stand depends on where you sit.

        Rufus Miles

-------------------------------------

The sublime is the art of exchanging easier for more difficult pleasures.

            Lucretius [attribution questionable]

Paraphrase:

   To approach the sublime is to exchange easier for more difficult pleasures.

  "Life, for him, was a purely practical function, not a question of phrasing."

  Henry James, describing a character in The Tragic Muse.

Have I done an unselfish thing? 

Well then, I have my reward. 

Keep this thought ever present, and persevere.

The society which scorns excellence in plumbing because plumbing is a
humble activity and tolerates shoddiness in philosophy because it is an
exalted activity will have neither good plumbing nor good philosophy.
Neither its pipes nor its theories will hold water.

There lies more faith in honest doubt, believe me, than in half the creeds.

            --- Fyodor Dostoevsky

--------------------------------------------

What did you do today?
Is anybody happier because you passed this way?
Does anyone remember that you spoke today?
The day is almost over, and its toiling time is through:
Is there anyone to utter now a kindly word of you?
Can you say tonight in parting with the day that's slipping fast,
That you helped a single person of the many that you passed?
Is a single heart rejoicing over what you did or said?
Does the one whose hopes were fading now with courage look ahead?
Did you waste the day or use it?  Was it well or sorely spent?
Did you leave a trail of kindness, or a scar of discontent?
As you close you eyes in slumber, do you think that you can say:
You have earned one more tomorrow by what you did today?

           OZYMANDIAS

I met a traveller from an antique land
Who said: `Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor  well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.
And on the pedestal these words appear --
"My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away.' 

--------------------------------------------

Ladies and gentlemen of the class of '97:

Wear sunscreen.  If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen
would be it. The long-term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by
scientists, whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my
own meandering experience. I will dispense this advice now.

Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth. Oh, never mind. You will not
understand the power and beauty of your youth until they've faded. But trust
me, in 20 years, you'll lookback at photos of yourself and recall in a way you
can't grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you
really looked. You are not as fat as you imagine.

Don't worry about the future. Or worry, but know that worrying is as effective
as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum. The real
troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried
mind, the kind that blindside you at 4 pm on some idle Tuesday.

Do one thing every day that scares you.

Sing.

Don't be reckless with other people's hearts. Don't put up with people who are
reckless with yours.

Floss.

Don't waste your time on jealousy. Sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're
behind. The race is long and, in the end, it's only with yourself.

Remember compliments you receive. Forget the insults. If you succeed in doing
this, tell me how.

Keep your old love letters. Throw away your old bank statements.

Stretch.

Don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life. The
most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with
their lives. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don't.

Get plenty of calcium. Be kind to your knees. You'll miss them when they're
gone.

Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't. Maybe you'll have children, maybe you
won't. Maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the funky chicken on
your 75th wedding anniversary. Whatever you do, don't congratulate yourself
too much, or berate yourself either. Your choices are half chance. So are
everybody else's.

Enjoy your body. Use it every way you can. Don't be afraid of it or of what
other people think of it. It's the greatest instrument you'll ever own.

Dance, even if you have nowhere to do it but your living room.

Read the directions, even if you don't follow them.

Do not read beauty magazines. They will only make you feel ugly.

Get to know your parents. You never know when they'll be gone for good. Be
nice to your siblings. They're your best link to your past and the people most
likely to stick with you in the future.

Understand that friends come and go, but with a precious few you should hold
on. Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle, because the older
you get, the more you need the people who knew you when you were young.

Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard. Live in
Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft.

Travel.

Accept certain inalienable truths: Prices will rise. Politicians will
philander. You, too, will get old. And when you do, you'll fantasize that when
you were young, prices were reasonable, politicians were noble, and children
respected their elders.

Respect your elders.

Don't expect anyone else to support you. Maybe you have a trust fund.  Maybe
you'll have a wealthy spouse. But you never know when either one might run
out.

Don't mess too much with your hair or by the time you're 40 it will look 85.

Be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply
it. Advice is a form of nostalgia. Dispensing it is a way of fishing the past
from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling
it for more than it's worth. But trust me on the sunscreen.

   Mary Schmich for the Chicago Tribune, Column, June 1, 1997

--------------------------------------------

Whereas the liberal mistake is to think that there is a
program or policy to alleviate every problem in the
world, the conservative flaw [mistake] is to be vigilant against
concentrations of power in government only -- not in the
private sector, where power can be wielded more secretly
and sometimes more dangerously. 

     Robert Kaplan
     Atlantic Monthly, December 1997

Those who will not reason
Perish in the act:
Those who will not act
Perish for that reason.

     Introduction to Poetry
      by  Billy Collins
      in  The Apple that Astonished Paris
          University of Arkansas Press

  I ask them to take a poem
  and hold it up to the light 
  like a color slide

  or press an ear against its hive.

  I say drop a mouse into a poem
  and watch him probe his way out,

  or walk inside the poem's room
  and feel the walls for a light switch.

  I want them to waterski
  across the surface of a poem
  waving at the author's name on the shore.

  But all they want to do
  is tie the poem to a chair with rope
  and torture a confession out of it.

  They begin beating it with a hose
  to find out what it really means.

--------------------------------------------

The Choice

 The intellect of man is forced to choose
 perfection of the life, or of the work,
 And if it take the second must refuse
 A heavenly mansion, raging in the dark.
 When all that story's finished, what's the news?
 In luck or out the toil has left its mark:
 That old perplexity an empty purse,
 Or the day's vanity, the night's remorse. 
                                     

   William Butler Yeats

         (from The Winding Stair and Other Poems)
