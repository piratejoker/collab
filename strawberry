The garden strawberry (or simply strawberry; Fragaria × ananassa)[1] is
a widely grown hybrid species of the genus Fragaria, collectively known
as the strawberries. It is cultivated worldwide for its fruit. The fruit
is widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright red color,
juicy texture, and sweetness. It is consumed in large quantities, either
fresh or in such prepared foods as preserves, juice, pies, ice creams,
milkshakes, and chocolates. Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas
are also widely used in many products like lip gloss, candy, hand
sanitizers, perfume, and many others.

The garden strawberry was first bred in Brittany, France, in the 1750s
via a cross of Fragaria virginiana from eastern North America and
Fragaria chiloensis, which was brought from Chile by Amédée-François
Frézier in 1714.[2] Cultivars of Fragaria × ananassa have replaced, in
commercial production, the woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca), which
was the first strawberry species cultivated in the early 17th
century.[3]

The strawberry is not, from a botanical point of view, a berry.
Technically, it is an aggregate accessory fruit, meaning that the fleshy
part is derived not from the plant's ovaries but from the receptacle
that holds the ovaries.[4] Each apparent "seed" (achene) on the outside
of the fruit is actually one of the ovaries of the flower, with a seed
inside it.[4]
